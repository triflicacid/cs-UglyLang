The following document contains ideas for the language

- Concatenation: currently expressions contains only one top-level items e.g. `name`. If multiple items should appear, they are concatenated.

E.g, `"Hello " "world"` ==> `Hello world`

- Some lines may end in `[<type>]`. If this is the case, it acts as a cast.
