# Ideas

The following section contains ideas for the language.

- ~~Re-do the type system. Use an object structure to represent the abstract struture of types. This would allow more complex types, such as arrays.~~

Given these changes: finish list methods, add ability to cast arrays (e.g. INT[] -> FLOAT[]), add ability to SET compounds names (e.g. SET seq.0: 5) using a ValueContext similar to a FunctionContext, and update the documentation and example scripts.

- Record a value's definition location

- Add a block comment (either via symbols such as /* ... */ or by keywords such as IGNORE .. RESUME)
